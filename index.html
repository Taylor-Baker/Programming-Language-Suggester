          There has never been a better time to start learning how to program. The barrier for entry is only your time and dedication, but doesn't even have to cost you any money. Oh sure, you can definitely find qualified and trained professionals to assist you for a (usually) fair price, but people are even learning how to program, from home, for free, every single day. So if it's so easy to access this information, why not give it a try?
        </p>
        <p>
          Inevitably, no matter what path you choose, you'll have to make this one decision: what programming language should I learn first?
        </p>
        <p>
          Now you have another choice before you; you could go online, do hours of careful research in an attempt to find the perfect first language, or; you can take our Language Suggester Quiz to find out the very best language to suit both your purpose and your personality.
