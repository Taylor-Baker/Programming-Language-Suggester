      <h2>Me? A computer programmer?</h2>
      <p>
        There has never been a better time to start learning how to program. The barrier for entry is only your time and dedication, but doesn't even have to cost you any money. Oh sure, you can definitely find qualified and trained professionals to assist you for a (usually) fair price, but people are even learning how to program, from home, for free, every single day. So if it's so easy to access this information, why not give it a try?
      </p>
      <p>
        Inevitably, no matter what path you choose, you'll have to make this one decision: what programming language should I learn first?
      </p>
      <p>
        Now you have another choice before you; you could go online, do hours of careful research in an attempt to find the perfect first language, or; you can take our Language Suggester Quiz to find out the very best language to suit both your purpose and your personality.

          <h3>Question 1 : Consider Your Platform</h3>
          <div class="question-description">

              <p>
                One of the first things to consider when writing code is what platform will best meet the needs of your application. Are you creating advanced desktop apps with robust features, or would the best medium for your code be something more lightweight and mobile? Perhaps you would like to create code that can run on both desktop <em>and</em> mobile, communicating seamlessly between the two. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Knowing what platform your code will be most useful on is a great first step to figuring out what coding language you should learn first.
